## 🚀 Setup

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- CUDA-enabled GPU (for faster processing)
- Virtual environment tools (e.g., virtualenv, pipenv)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/varungadd/Monitoring-Motar-Skills-in-Infants.git
   cd Monitoring-Motar-Skills-in-Infants

2.Create a virtual environment:

python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`

3. Install dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt

4. Set up the project by running the provided scripts:

python Infant-Pose-Estimation/download_pretrained_fidip.py
python Infant-Pose-Estimation/download_pretrained_hrnet.py
python Infant-Pose-Estimation/download_syrip_data.py


🔧 Usage

Running the Model on a Single Image

1. Use the predict_v6.py script to perform pose estimation on a single image:

python Infant-Pose-Estimation/tools/predict_v6.py --image_path path_to_your_image


2. Running the Model on Videos

Use the predict_video_v2.py script to perform pose estimation on a video:
